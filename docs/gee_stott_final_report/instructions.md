Hi class,

Please submit the final project report in PDF file format in this submission folder by 12/05/2025, 11:59 pm MT.

The report will be in two column IEEE format. Latex and Microsoft Office formats are available in the IEEE website
Links to an external site. Links to an external site.. For formatting issues, you can see one example paper in Sequence_Model-based_End-to-End_Solar_Flare_Classification_from_Multivariate_Time_Series_Data.pdf

For research projects, the page limit is 4 pages without references, and for survey projects, the page limit is 6 pages without references. If your report contains one or two more pages than the above limits, your report will not be penalized. But, if the report is too small (e.g., 1-2 pages), or two large (>10 pages), you might be penalized. Also, make sure so that your report does not contain unnecessary white spaces, free of grammatical mistakes, and figures and their fonts are easily readable in the PDF file.

The organization and grade distribution of your report will be:

    Title and abstract: 5%
    Introduction: 15%
    Related Work: 10%
    Proposed Method (research) /taxonomy of existing algorithms (survey): 25%
    Experiments: 25%
        Dataset description: 8%
        Baseline description: 7%
        Experimental evaluation with visualizations: 10%
    Conclusion and future work: 5%
    References: 5%
    Code verification (not included in the report; performed by the grading team): 10%

Please upload all of your code in GitHub with the readme file of code execution instructions and dependencies, and make sure that the the repository is downloadable and executable by the deadline. Add the link of source code in the report (e.g., as a footnote in the experiment section).

Finally, please note that you need to submit your presentation slides (and video in case of online presentation) by 12/03. The presentation and the report have independent grading.
